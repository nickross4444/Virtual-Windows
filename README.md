## Git Guidelines

To ensure smooth collaboration and avoid conflicts, follow these guidelines:

1. **Branching**:
   - Create a new branch for each feature or fix.
   - Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature-virtual-windows`, `fix-bug-xyz`).

2. **Committing**:
   - Avoid committing directly to the `main` branch.
   - Write clear and concise commit messages (e.g., `Add snapping functionality to virtual windows`).

3. **Merging**:
   - Merge branches into `main` only after completion and testing.
   - Use Unity's YAML merge tool for resolving merge conflicts:
